For the assignment I used two of my favorite movies to see how the code would respond to two very different types of movies.
The movies I used are 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'.

For 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' I just ran the code based on the Summary.
I did lower the value of 0.99 to 0.50 and 0.10, since the first two weren't giving my any results.
After lowering the value to 0.10 I did get various recommendations, with the first one being 'Pirates of the Caribbean'.
First I was suprised by this result but then I remembered that Johnny Depp plays the main character in both movies.
This must have be described in the Summary of both movies since I didn't run the code based on Starring.

For 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' I ran the code based on Summary, Starring & title.
When using Summary at 0.50 I unsurprisingly got a bunch of other Star Wars movies such as 'Revenge of the Sith' & 'Return of the Jedi'.

When using Starring at 0.10 I got only 3 results. Unsurpringly these were the other two movies from the same trilogy which mostly share the same cast.
I was however surprised by the absence of 2015's 'The Force Awakens' which brings back most of the cast from the original three movies.
I also thought it was odd that the other two movies from the trilogy had values of 0.52 and 0.48 while the cast is mostly similar.
Perhaps the difference can be explained by a large amount of background actors and actresses who only appear in one of the movies.

Lastly, I also used title. This gave me the most surprising result of all, the movie with the highest value was 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.
I was expecting movies like 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, since almost half of the title is already the same to 'The Empire Strikes Back'.
It should however be noted that all three of the results are in fact produced by Lucasfilm just like 'The Empire Strikes Back'.
Perhaps this has something to do with the result, although I don't see what this has to do with the title of the movies.
